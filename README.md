### Hi there üëã

I am an iOS Engineer with +9 years of experience currently building safe and secure Pay Later Experience at [Tabby](https://tabby.ai/).

In the past, I worked at [Pure](https://pure.app), [Meditation & Sleep](https://momeditation.app), and on [these projects](https://pyshnovt.github.io/assets/CV-Tim-Pyshnov.pdf).

## My Expertise

I focus on creating maintainable architecture and making *insanely great* user experience for customers.

- üí∏ Know how to work with money: currencies, locales, formatting, edge cases, decimals. Years of experience working in a bank. Implemented my own MoneyFormatter, following [best practices](https://flight.school/books/numbers/).
- üè° Write scalable code for humans to read. Prefer [functional and declarative code](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell). Use [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) for my projects, but had had an experience working with MVC, MVVM, VIPER, RxSwift.
- üåà Making customers happy: smooth scroll views (fast layout and drawing, caching), pixel-perfect layout true to Figma even on smallest iPhones, and [lickable buttons](https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1215125772849045504).

## My Passion

- üî• Recently, I've become obsessed with computer graphics and wrote a simple [raycasting engine](https://github.com/PyshnovT/raycasting).
- üê∂ Implementing data structures in C through [Leetcode challenges](https://leetcode.com/PyshnovT/).
- üìñ Learning about [Hardware](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319) and GPU. Always [love](https://www.objc.io/issues/3-views/moving-pixels-onto-the-screen/) to [dig deeper](https://www.nand2tetris.org) to see [how things work](https://github.com/PyshnovT/swift-structures/tree/main).
