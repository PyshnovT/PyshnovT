### Hi there 👋

I am an iOS Engineer with +7 years of experience currently building safe and secure Pay Later Experience at [Tabby](https://tabby.ai/).

In the past, I worked at [Pure](https://pure.app), [Meditation & Sleep](https://momeditation.app), and on [these projects](https://pyshnovt.github.io/assets/CV-Tim-Pyshnov.pdf).

## My Expertise

I focus on creating maintainable architecture with my collegues and making *insanely great* user experience for customers.

Also:
- 💸 Wrote a Money Formatter with support of multiple currencies, English and Arabic. Followed [best practices](https://flight.school/books/numbers/) on working with money.
- 🔥 Recently, I've became obsessed with computer graphics and I wrote a simple [ray casting engine]().

## My Passion

- Love [Hardware 📖](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Language-Computer-Hardware-Software/dp/0735611319) and GPU. Always love to dig deeper to see how things work.
- Learning C language through [Leetcode challenges](https://leetcode.com/PyshnovT/).
- Those are my favorite books and articles on computer science.

## My Philosophy

- 🤌 I care a lot about [clear APIs](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/designing-swift-apis/) for developers and scalable code.
- 🏡 Use [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) for my projects, but have had an experience working with MVC, MVVM, VIPER, RxSwift. Prefer functional and declarative programming over imperative.
